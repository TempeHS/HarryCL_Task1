# How to test my site

- Type into the terminal: python main.py
- Open up a new terminal and type: python api.py
- Go to ports, observe the fowarded addresss, and copy it into the browser URL
- DO NOT USE THE SIMPLE BROWSER IN THE CODESPACE

# How to use the site

To use the site and bypass 2FA, you can use the credentials

- Username: AdminUser
- Password: P@ssword123
- Skip to index page instructions

However I strongly recommend you try signing up and testing the 2FA feature

- A strong password suggestion that passes all the requirements is P@ssword123

# 2FA Page

Once You successfully create an account, you will be redirected to the 2FA page

- Get the Google Authenticator App and scan the QR code, do not delete the code off the phone, as you will need it to log back in (it changes every few seconds)
