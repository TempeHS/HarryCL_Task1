# List of achievables

---

# Increment (what must achieved by end of sprint)

---

- The search entries page, have parameters can be the developer, data project or diary contents
- Ability to go to diary entry from the summaries to view full entry
- Code additions have prism.js and prism css in diary logs
- Add tls,ssl encryption

# Sprint Review (focus on project management)

---

## What challenges did you have

- Creating the view full entry from the summary as it involved defining a data path that weeved through 5 different files, making debugging harder
- Creating the search page and the search function
- Implementing prism for the code addittions 
- The layout page/csp not allowing for redirects when making view full entry

## What did you do well

- Was able to work through the issues until they were completely resolved
- Added debugging statements for the api and main logs to pinpoint the issue
- Effective use of SQL for the search
- Abstraction to enhance code readibility for main.py and api.py

## What will you do differently next time

- Add more debugging statements to pinpoint the issue faster
- Rely less on external sites for solutions to problems that do not apply
